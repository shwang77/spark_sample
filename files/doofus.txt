Doofus Drake voiced by Townsend Coleman is a friend of Huey Dewey and Louie and Launchpads sidekick 
Generally speaking Doofus is a rather dimwitted and clumsy character with a positive attitude as insatiable as his appetite
He exhibits hero worship for Launchpad which frequently borders on the delusional
The relationship between Doofus and Launchpad in many ways mirrors that of Launchpad and Scrooge
Doofus is also marked by his strong moral compass best demonstrated in the episode Superdoo in which he uses newly acquired superpowers to save the Junior Woodchucks from catastrophe only to voluntarily relinquish them for the sake of hard work and friendship
